# artefact
A playful yet educational web platform that challenges users to distinguish between AI-generated and human-created content. The goal is to raise awareness about AIâ€™s role in different industries and the lack of transparency in its usage. 

"Artefact" reflects the duality between human creativity and machine-made content. What we share online (our art, ideas, image) becomes a kind of cultural artefact, capturing a moment in time that may never return. These fragments are later scraped, repurposed, and transformed into digital artefacts, blurring the boundary between the human and the machine.
